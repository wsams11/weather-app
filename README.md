# Weather Dashboard

## Description
I have created an app that will display useful weather information for the current day and also the 5 day forcast. This app will give you the current tempature along with current wind speed, humidity and if there is an overcast. It will also display the UV Index in your searched area. The 5 day forcast will display below the current weather infomation and give you the expected high along with humidity and if there is a chance of overcast! It will also display all of your searched cities!
